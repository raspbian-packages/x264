This package ships non-PIC code in shared objects in the i386 variant

The reason is that x264 uses a lot of hand written assembler that is not
relocatable for performance reasons. Writing the assembler code in a way
that is becomes relocatable is unfeasible.

Upstream takes care to use non-pic code only on architectures that
support this.
